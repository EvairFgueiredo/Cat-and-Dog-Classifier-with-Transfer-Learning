# Cat-and-Dog-Classifier-with-Transfer-Learning

# Description:
Welcome to the Cat and Dog Classifier! This amazing project utilizes deep learning techniques to distinguish between cats and dogs in images. The code is a fascinating journey from data preprocessing to the creation and training of a transfer learning model based on the powerful MobileNetV2 architecture.

# Highlighted Features:

Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2: We leverage the pre-existing knowledge of the MobileNetV2 neural network trained on the ImageNet dataset to expedite training and enhance accuracy.

Creative Data Augmentation: We employ data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flipping, rotation, and zoom, to diversify the training set, improve generalization, and make the model robust.

Interactive Visualizations: Explore engaging visualizations that showcase data augmentation and transformations applied to images during training.

Dynamic Monitoring: Track training progress with interactive visualizations of accuracy and loss over epochs, making it easy to understand model performance.

Comprehensive Evaluation: After training, assess the model's performance on a dedicated test set, highlighting essential metrics such as loss and accuracy.

Simple Save and Load: Save your trained model effortlessly for future use and explore the option to reload it when needed.
